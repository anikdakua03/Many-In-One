> There are steps where we can set up our environment variable in cloud run.

## Steps to run locally :

1. Get all the files.
2. Create enviroments folder inside **src** folder, then create **environment.development.ts** and **environment.ts** file.
3. Next insert these credentials and update with your credentials.
```ts
export const environment = {
    production: true,
    apiBaseUrl: "API_URL", 
    clientId: "FOR_GOOGLE_LOGIN_GET_ID_FROM_GCLOUD",
    cryptoSecretKey: "IF_WANT_TO_USE_CRYPTOGRAPHY_FOR_HIDING_SENSITIVE"
};
```
